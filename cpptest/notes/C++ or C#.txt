PROBLEM CONTEXT

	Some points are present on a number line:
        ( marked by "x" )

        0_._|_._1_._|_._2_._|_._3_._|_._ ...
        
         x      xx   x  x    x

	We want to determine which sets of points (if any) exhibit a regular
	spacing ( e.g. a set of points [2.1, 3.6, 4.1, 6.1, 8.1 ...] has
    points with a regular spacing of 2.0 ).

PART I
	
	Define a data structure to hold a set of points.
	How would you initialize this data structure?
	What about file storage?
	What if points need the ability to have additional attributes?

PART II

	However, we are ultimately uninterested in considering points which
	are really close together ( e.g. out of points 5.0 and 5.01, only
    one point should be kept ).

	Assume this data structure has been populated for you.
	Write an algorithm to accept this data structure and
	filter points on the basis of some minimum distance.

PART III

	Devise an algorithm to identify whether or not a regular spacing
	of a given distance exists between 3 or more points in this set
    ( e.g., the spacing 2.0 exists in the set [3.1, 5.1, 7.1], but a
    spacing 4.0 does not ).
