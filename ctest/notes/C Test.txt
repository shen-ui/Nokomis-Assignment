You need to write a C function to perform some task:

    int do_task( result_t *result )
    {
        /* ... */
    }

This task involves calling do_subtask() on resources A, B, and C, and getting a
result:

    resource_a_t *this_a;
    resource_b_t *this_b;
    resource_c_t *this_c;
    
    int do_subtask(
        resource_a_t    *this_a,
        resource_b_t    *this_b,
        resource_c_t    *this_c,
        result_t        *result
    );

Within your function, you must acquire A, B, and C using the functions:

    int             acquire_a( resource_a_t **a );
    resource_b_t *  acquire_b( resource_a_t *a );
    void            acquire_c( resource_a_t *a, resource_c_t **c, int *ecode );

However, any or all of them may fail, in which case attempting to use the
respective resource is forbidden.

Before exiting do_task(), you must release any acquired resources:

    void release_a( resource_a_t *a );
    void release_b( resource_b_t *b );
    void release_c( resource_c_t *c );

Your function must return 0 on success.
